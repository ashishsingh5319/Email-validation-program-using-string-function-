**Email Validation Program**<br/>
This Python program validates an email address based on a set of rules using string functions and regular expressions. The program ensures that the email follows proper structure and avoids invalid characters.

**ðŸš€ Features**<br/>
âœ” Validates the email length (must be at least 6 characters).<br/>
âœ” Ensures the first character is a letter.<br/>
âœ” Checks that there is exactly one "@" symbol in the email.<br/>
âœ” Ensures the domain part ends with .com, .in, .org, or .edu.<br/>
âœ” No spaces or uppercase letters are allowed in the email.<br/>
âœ” Validates that only allowed characters are used (a-z, 0-9, @, ., _).<br/>

**Installation** <br/>
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. No external libraries are required.
